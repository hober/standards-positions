# WebKit's positions on emerging web specifications

## What is this Repository?

The [WebKit Open Source Project](https://webkit.org) uses [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions) to come to consensus on various Web standards proposals. Once we've come to consensus, we publish our positions on the [WebKit Feature Status page](https://webkit.org/status/).

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/new) if you'd like us to generate a position on some web-facing API.
